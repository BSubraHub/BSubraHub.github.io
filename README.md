## Projects

### [Project 1: Api Gateway Lambda Integration](https://github.com/BSubraHub/api_gateway_lambda_integration_using_serverless)
This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda functions using a custom authorizer. The Serverless Application Model (SAM) is utilized to define and deploy the resources required for this serverless architecture.

- **Technologies**: AWS, Python, CloudFormation, AWS Lambda
- **Description**: This project, I build a simple serverless application that exposes RESTful APIs through Amazon API Gateway. These APIs will be backed by AWS Lambda functions responsible for processing incoming requests and generating appropriate responses. Additionally, I have implemented a custom authorizer to authenticate and authorize requests before they are routed to the Lambda functions.

### [Project 2: AWS control tower management AFT](https://github.com/BSubraHub/aws-control-tower-management-aft)
This repository contains configuration for the AWS Account Factory for Terraform module. The module creates a pipeline of AWS services that allow you to create and customize AWS Control Tower accounts through Terraform configuration.

- **Technologies**: Terraform, AWS
- **Description**: The "aws-control-tower-management-aft" repository serves as a centralized hub for managing the Account Factory for Terraform (AFT) module configuration within a cloud infrastructure setup. This repository houses crucial configuration files, scripts, and documentation essential for the proper functioning and management of the AFT module.

### [Project 3: AWS control tower account request](https://github.com/BsubraHub/aws-control-tower-aft-account-request)
This repository contains example configuration to kick off new account provisioning using AFT or add existing account.

- **Technologies**: Terraform, AWS, Python, Shell script
- **Description**: This repository contains boilerplate configuration for defining account requests to use with the Account Factory for Terraform module. The AFT pipeline requires the structure used and the included submodule to define a DynamoDB table item with your account specifications.

### [Project 4: AWS control tower account customisations](https://github.com/BsubraHub/aws-control-tower-aft-account-customisations)
This repository contains boilerplate configuration for defining account customizations to use with the Account Factory for Terraform module.

- **Technologies**: Terraform, AWS, Python, Shell script
- **Description**: This repo stores the Terraform and API helpers for the Account Customizations. Account Customizations are used to customize all provisioned accounts with customer defined resources. The resources can be created through Terraform or through Python, leveraging the API helpers. The customization run is parameterized at runtime.

### [Project 5: AWS control tower gloabl account customisations](https://github.com/BsubraHub/aws-control-tower-aft-global-account-customisation)
This repository contains boilerplate configuration for defining global customizations to use with the Account Factory for Terraform module.

- **Technologies**: Terraform, AWS, Python, Shell script
- **Description**: This repo stores the Terraform and API helpers for the Global Customizations. Global Customizations are used to customize all provisioned accounts with customer defined resources. The resources can be created through Terraform or through Python, leveraging the API helpers. The customization run is parameterized at runtime.

### [Project 5: AWS control tower AFT with github actions](https://github.com/BsubraHub/aws-control-tower-aft-with-github-actions)
This repository contains configuration for the AWS Account Factory for Terraform module. The module creates a pipeline of AWS services that allow you to create and customize AWS Control Tower accounts through Terraform configuration. The deployment is orchestrated via continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions.

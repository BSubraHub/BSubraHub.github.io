## Projects

### [Project 1: Api Gateway Lambda Integration](https://github.com/BSubraHub/api_gateway_lambda_integration_using_serverless)
This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda functions using a custom authorizer. The Serverless Application Model (SAM) is utilized to define and deploy the resources required for this serverless architecture.

- **Technologies**: AWS, Python, CloudFormation, AWS Lambda
- **Description**: This project, I build a simple serverless application that exposes RESTful APIs through Amazon API Gateway. These APIs will be backed by AWS Lambda functions responsible for processing incoming requests and generating appropriate responses. Additionally, I have implemented a custom authorizer to authenticate and authorize requests before they are routed to the Lambda functions.

### [Project 3: Machine Learning Model for Predictive Analytics](https://github.com/yourusername/project3)
A machine learning project focused on building predictive models to forecast sales using historical data.

- **Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Jupyter
- **Description**: Implemented various regression models to predict future sales and evaluated their performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
